create view query2b as select worksite,year,count(case_status) as total from h1b_final where case_status = "CERTIFIED" and year in ('2011','2012','2013','2014','2015','2016') group by worksite,year sort by year,total desc;

(I have created a view of this output)

select year,worksite,total,rank from (select year,worksite,rank() over (partition by year order by total desc) as rank,total from query2b ) ranked_table where ranked_table.rank<=5;

this leads to top 5 sites of US who are having certified as case_status
